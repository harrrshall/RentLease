    "severity_score": 9,
    "summary": "Landlords frequently overstep legal boundaries by violating tenant privacy and lease terms, driven by a desire to control property use or expedite vacancies. This overreach, often stemming from a misunderstanding or disregard for tenant rights and legal notice periods, escalates disputes and incurs significant legal and financial penalties.",
    "the_trigger": "Landlord's attempt to exert control beyond lease terms or legal rights, such as unauthorized entry, enforcing unenforceable clauses, or demanding early vacancy without proper notice or compensation.",
    "the_escalation": "Tenant challenges the landlord's actions, leading to increased harassment or retaliatory behavior from the landlord. This can involve repeated violations, threats, or attempts to force the tenant out through non-legal means, prompting tenants to seek legal counsel or document the landlord's misconduct.",
    "the_fatal_mistake": "The landlord's failure to adhere to legal notice requirements for lease termination or entry, or engaging in unauthorized entry and harassment, instead of pursuing lawful eviction processes.",

        "She entered my apartment today when I was not home and unplugged it. She did not provide a warning. I feel like this was a complete invasion of privacy as this was not an emergency, and my lease states she must give notice unless it is an emergency.",
        "The landlord screwed up and either needs to give the legally required timeframe or pay for their screwup."

        "Always provide legally mandated notice for entry and lease termination; if seeking early vacancy, offer a formal 'cash for keys' agreement with clear terms and compensation."
