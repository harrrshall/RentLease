    "summary": "Operators mistakenly believe past success and existing networks negate the need for ongoing, proactive marketing and client acquisition. This leads to a decline in business when market conditions shift or personal circumstances change, as the foundation of inbound leads erodes without consistent effort.",
    "the_trigger": "A period of high sales volume or a significant life event (e.g., new job, personal break) leads to a reduction in active client acquisition and marketing efforts.",
    "the_escalation": "1. Reduced prospecting and marketing activities. 2. Income significantly decreases due to lack of new client acquisition. 3. Significant effort and financial investment are required to regain previous income levels, often taking many months.",
    "the_fatal_mistake": "Belief that past success and a large network would sustain income without consistent, ongoing effort and investment during periods of reduced activity.",

        "The harder you work the luckier you get.",
